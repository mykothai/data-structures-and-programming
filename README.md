## Heap Class
Complete the implementation of a Heap class that stores integer pairs, which includes heap constructors, trickle up, trickle down and extract minimum functions.

## Link List Stack
Completed the stack class, created a Makefile and a main function to test the stack class.
This program takes in user inputed words and outputs a concatenation of the words in reverse order then output the words in order line by line.

## List Difference (with Priority Queues)
Given two lists of integers, L1 and L2, this program outputs the largest number that occurs in L1 but does not occur in L2, or "None" if there is no such number. The program first creates the lists, L1 and L2, by reading in a text file with integers where 0 denotes the end of one list. Each list is sorted by the C++ STL priority queue class used. The top elements of each list are compared to determine the largest number that occurs in L1 but does not occur in L2.
